        <h2>
            What is air pollution?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Air pollution happens when harmful substances like smoke, gases, and tiny particles get into the air we
            breathe from things like cars, factories, and fires. Air pollutants include greenhouse gases such as carbon
            dioxide and methane.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Why is air pollution a problem?
        </h2>

        <p>
            When these pollutants build up in the air, they can cause a range of health and environmental problems.
            Breathing in polluted air can lead to respiratory issues like asthma and bronchitis, and it can also
            increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems.

            <br><br>Additionally, air pollution can harm the
            environment by damaging plants, ecosystems, and even buildings and monuments.
        </p>

        <h2>
            How can we solve this problem?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Efforts to combat air pollution include reducing emissions from sources like vehicles and industrial
            facilities, as well as promoting cleaner energy sources and practices, all aimed at improving both human
            health and environmental quality.
