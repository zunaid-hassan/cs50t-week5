        <h2>
            What are higher temperatures?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Higher temperatures refer to temperatures that are warmer or hotter than usual. In the context of climate
            change or global warming, it means that the average temperature of the Earth's surface is increasing over
            time due to factors like greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Why are higher temperatures a problem?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Higher temperatures lead to more frequent heatwaves, hotter days, and changes in weather patterns, which can
            have various impacts on human health, ecosystems, and weather-related phenomena like wildfires and storms.
            <br><br>
            Almost everywhere on land areas, there are more hot days and heat waves now. This makes people more likely
            to
            get sick from the heat and makes outdoor work harder. In the Arctic, temperatures have risen at least twice
            as fast as the global average.

        <h2>
            How can we solve this problem?
        </h2>

        <p>
            We need to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere. This means using cleaner
            energy sources like solar and wind power instead of burning fossil fuels like coal and oil. We can also save
            energy by being more efficient with how we use it, like turning off lights when we don't need them and using
            energy-efficient appliances. Planting trees and protecting forests also helps because trees absorb carbon
            dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases.
