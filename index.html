        What is climate change?
      </h2>

      <p>
        <em><b>Climate change</b></em> refers to the changing state of the Earth's atmosphere.
        <br><br>
        Historically,
        temperature of the planet fluctuated due to natural processes. Recently, however, there has been a drastic shift
        in Earth's
        atmosphere
        that is unrelated to natural
        causes. A prominent driver is <em><b>global warming</b></em>, with the Earth's average temperature
        rising
        1.18°C since the 19th century, caused by the <em><b>greenhouse effect</b></em>.

      <h2>
        What is the greenhouse effect?
      </h2>

      <p>
        The <em><b>greenhouse effect</b></em> is the process which traps heat in Earth's atmosphere, causing
        the temperature to rise. This is driven by increasing <em><b>greenhouse gases</b></em> like carbon dioxide
        produced by industrialization. This carbon dioxide rise correlates with rising temperatures, linking climate
        change to human activities. Global
        warming causes climate change, which has numerous adverse effects on the Earth, as formally defined by NASA:
      </p>

      <blockquote align="justify">
        "Climate change is a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by
        burning <b>fossil fuels</b>, which add heat-trapping gases to Earth’s
        atmosphere. These phenomena include the increased temperature
        trends described by global warming, but also encompass changes
        such as sea-level rise; ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica,
        the Arctic and mountain glaciers worldwide; shifts in flower/plant
        blooming; and <b>extreme weather events.</b>"

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>While climate change is a complex and evolving issue, it's importance cannot be stressed enough. And this
        importance can perhaps be best emphasized by the following Native American proverb:</p>
      <blockquote><b>“We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.”</b></blockquote>
