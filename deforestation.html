            What is deforestation?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Deforestation is when trees in forests are cut down or cleared away, usually by people. This happens for
            various
            reasons, like making room for farms, building cities, or getting wood for things like furniture and paper.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Why is deforestation a problem?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Trees help reduce carbon dioxide by converting them into oxygen. When trees are cut down, this conversion
            stops. The stored carbondioxide is also released from the trees, creating two negative effects.
            <br><br>
            Deforestation occurs mainly due to agriculture, which is responsible for around 80% of all deforestations.
            This
            need for agriculture is fueled by an increasing population of human beings, which is projected to reach 9
            billion by 2050.

            <br><br>

            Trees also provide home and shelter for different animals and plants. Cutting them down results in a loss of
            habitat for these animals and plants.

        <h2>
            How can we solve this problem?
        </h2>

        <p>
            First, we can plant more trees in areas where forests have been cut down. Second, we need to protect the
            forests we still have by making rules against cutting them down illegally and by creating protected
            areas. Third, we can use forests more sustainably by only cutting down trees that we need and planting
            new ones to replace them. <b>But most importantly, alternatives to agriculture must be found to reduce
                deforestation.</b>
