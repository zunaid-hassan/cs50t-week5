            What are wildfires?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Wildfires are big fires that happen in forests, grasslands, or other areas with lots of plants. They start
            from things like lightning, human activities, or even hot weather. Once they start, they can spread quickly,
            burning everything in their path, including trees, plants, and even homes.

        </p>

        <h2>
            Why are wildifires a problem?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Wildfires cause habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity by burning down forests, grasslands, and other
            natural areas, displacing or killing plants and animals.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, wildfires release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the
            atmosphere, contributing further to climate change and air pollution. The loss of vegetation also leads to
            soil erosion and degradation, affecting water quality and disrupting ecosystems.

        <h2>
            How can we solve this problem?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Firstly, we should work on preventing fires by enforcing rules like fire bans during dry times and educating
            people about fire safety. Secondly, we need to be ready to fight fires when they happen by using technology
            to detect them early and deploying firefighters quickly. Lastly, we can make forests and other areas more
            resilient to fires by restoring them and managing vegetation.
